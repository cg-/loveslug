>We want to make a safe and fun environment for UC Santa Cruz students to be able to meet people to date.

##Overview

LoveSlugs is an online dating site that will cater towards current UC Santa Cruz students. Users will create accounts and will have a personalized homepage. Each user will have a profile where they can write information about themselves, and can identify their interests. We will have a database table for user accounts, and it will also contain the userâ€™s profile information. Users will also be able to upload a picture of themselves, which we will store on the server, with a URI stored in the database to allow us to access it. The main site will allow for users to message each other, and it will allow users to search for other users with similar interests.
